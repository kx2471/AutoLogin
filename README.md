# AutoLogin

This project automates logging in to a website and includes a small scheduler
UI. Tests are provided using Python's built in `unittest` framework.

## Running tests

Execute the test suite from the project root with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This discovers and runs all tests inside the `tests/` directory.
